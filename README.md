# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Model
This project predicts stock price trends using Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on datasets from S&amp;P 500 (US stocks), NSE 50 (Indian stocks), and ADANI Enterprises (single Indian stock). The objective is to forecast whether a stock's closing price will rise or fall the next day based on historical data.


# Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance

The objective is to forecast whether the stock's closing price will rise or fall the next day based on historical data. The project involves data retrieval using the `yfinance` library, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Key steps include:

- Cleaning the historical stock market data and visualizing price trends.
- Creating custom features such as rolling averages and price differences.
- Training models to classify stock movements and making predictions for trend forecasting.

The project showcases the effectiveness of Random Forest Classifier for larger datasets and KNN for individual stock analysis, achieving significant accuracy in predictions.
